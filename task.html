New Delhi:
India and Pakistan face each other in their high-octane clash at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday, September 14. Amidst the rising calls for the boycott, the high-octane clash lacked some of its usual fervour. Meanwhile, the Indian government had given a go-ahead for the clash.

 Pakistan captain Salman Agha Ali won the toss and opted to bat first. However, ahead of the clash, there was an awkward moment during Pakistan's national anthem. The DJ mistakenly played an English song, named Jalebi Baby, for a few seconds instead of Pakistan's anthem. The song was paused quickly, and the Pakistan anthem was turned on soon.
